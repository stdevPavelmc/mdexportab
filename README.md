# MDaemon tool to export the users's address books in case of a migration

This is a handy python script to export all the users addressbooks from the WorldClient MDaemon to a csv format.

## Why?

Simply because it's trivial and some paid apps want you to give 90 bucks for it.

## How?

0. Install python 3.8 on your windows PC that has MDaemon
0. Copy the script to the folder that holds your domain accounts
0. Open a python shell on that folder and run the script

You will note a `output` directory with a lot of csv files, one per user

## This is a work in progress...

More to come...
